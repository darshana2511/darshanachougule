  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I am a result-driven DevOps & Automation Engineer with <strong>12+ years of experience</strong> 
      designing, automating, and optimizing enterprise IT platforms across Cloud, DevOps, and 
      Infrastructure domains. I specialize in building end-to-end automation solutions using 
      <strong>PowerShell, Azure Automation, Logic Apps, Azure DevOps, and CI/CD pipelines</strong> 
      to eliminate manual work, reduce operational risk, and improve service reliability.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      A major focus of my career has been <strong>fully automating Service Desk and IT Operations tasks</strong>. 
      I have designed and delivered automations that replaced repetitive manual activities, 
      significantly reduced ticket resolution times, and enabled 24/7 self-service operations 
      for large enterprise and government environments.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      In addition to automation, I have built <strong>real-time monitoring and reporting solutions</strong> 
      using <strong>Splunk and Power BI</strong>. These dashboards provide operational visibility into 
      system health, automation success/failure rates, SLA compliance, and service performance, 
      enabling teams and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and proactively address issues.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      My work blends <strong>Cloud-Native Design, DevOps, and Intelligent Automation</strong>, 
      leveraging Azure services and scripting to automate identity management, infrastructure provisioning, 
      monitoring, compliance, and security workflows. I also bring experience in 
      <strong>AI strategy, GenAI, MLOps, and data platforms</strong>, using services like Azure OpenAI, 
      Databricks, Synapse, and Cognitive Services to enhance operational decision-making and customer experience.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      I have successfully delivered solutions in <strong>Financial Services, Telecom, and Government</strong> sectors, 
      working in highly regulated environments that demand security, reliability, and scalability. 
      I am fluent in English, conversational in Dutch, and well-versed in the Dutch way of working.
